# Dice game project

Small dice game built with Javascript DOM manipulation. <br />
Just open this link https://dice-game-raul.netlify.app/ to play, reset and have fun. <br />
It can be played with 2 players. <br />
<br />

Rules are simple:<br />
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":<br />
-If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.<br />
-If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their current score and the player's turn continues.<br />
-If a player chooses to "hold", their current score is added to their total score , and it becomes the next player's turn.<br />
The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
